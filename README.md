# google-docs-comment-and-suggestion-exporter
A Google Apps Script to export all comments, suggestions, and edits from a Google Doc into a single, comprehensive Google Sheet. This script uses a combination of the Google Drive API (v2) and the Google Docs API (v1) to overcome common API limitations and capture all relevant document changes for easy review.
