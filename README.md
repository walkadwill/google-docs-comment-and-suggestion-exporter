Google Docs Comment and Suggestion Exporter
Project Description
This Google Apps Script is a comprehensive solution for exporting all a Google Doc's comments, suggestions, and edits into a single, organized Google Sheet. It's built to overcome the limitations of Google's APIs and is a great tool for anyone who needs to review extensive redlines, a common practice in legal, content, or technical documentation.

Features
Exports All Changes: Captures standard comments, as well as tracked changes like insertions and deletions.

Unified View: Combines all comments and suggestions into a single spreadsheet for a complete overview.

Chronological Sorting: Sorts all changes by their creation date, allowing you to review them in the order they were made.

Robust & Reliable: Built with pagination to handle documents with hundreds or thousands of changes without timing out.

Direct Links: Generates direct, clickable links to each comment in the Google Doc for quick navigation.

How to Use
Step 1: Create a Google Apps Script Project
Open any Google Doc (it doesn't have to be the one you want to export).

Go to Extensions > Apps Script from the top menu.

A new browser tab will open with the script editor.

Step 2: Enable the Necessary APIs
This script uses two different Google APIs. You must enable both.

In the Apps Script editor, click the 'Services' icon on the left (it looks like a plus sign).

Find and add the 'Google Drive API'. Select version V2.

Find and add the 'Google Docs API'. Select version V1.

Step 3: Insert the Code
Copy all the code from the Code.gs file in this repository.

In the Apps Script editor, replace any existing code with the code you copied.

On line 3 of the script, replace the placeholder with your Google Doc ID:

JavaScript

const docId = 'YOUR_DOCUMENT_ID_HERE';

Step 4: Run the Script
Click the 'Run' button (the play icon) in the toolbar.

The first time you run it, you will be asked to authorize the script. Follow the prompts to grant it the necessary permissions.

The script will execute and create a new Google Sheet in your Google Drive with the name All Comments & Suggestions from "[Your Document Name]".

Troubleshooting
Script fails with GoogleJsonResponseException: This almost always means one of the APIs was not enabled or is the wrong version. Go back to Step 2 and double-check your services.

Script runs but the sheet is empty: The script is failing to find data. Ensure your Doc ID is correct and that the document has comments or suggestions.

Script runs for a long time and times out: For extremely large documents, the script may exceed the 6-minute execution limit. The current script is optimized, but this can still happen with tens of thousands of edits. In this case, you can try reducing the maxResults from 100 to a smaller number.
